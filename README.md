#  News Classifier (AG News Dataset)

A production-ready **Machine Learning web application** that classifies news articles into categories such as **World, Sports, Business, and Technology** using Natural Language Processing (NLP).

Built with **Scikit-learn** and deployed using **Streamlit**, this project demonstrates a complete end-to-end ML pipeline from data preprocessing to model deployment.

##  Dataset

This project uses the **AG News Dataset**, which contains thousands of labeled news articles across four categories:

* World
* Sports
* Business
* Sci/Tech

### Dataset Format:

```
class_index, title, description
```

The model combines `title` and `description` into a single text feature for training.

---

##  Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/news-classifier.git
cd news-classifier
```

### 2. Add dataset

* Download AG News dataset
* Rename `train.csv` → `news.csv`
* Place inside:

```
data/news.csv
```

---

## ▶️ Run the Application

### Option 1: One-click run (Recommended)

```
run.bat
```

### Option 2: Manual run

```
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

pip install -r requirements.txt

python src/train_model.py
streamlit run app.py
```
